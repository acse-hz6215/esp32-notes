# Environment Setup 
  
## Flash commands
```sh
#check serial ports
ls /dev/cu.*   

# set environment variables
. $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh 

idf.py set-target TARGET

idf.py -p PORT

idf.py build

#this will actually flash and build the same time
idf.py flash 

# this will flash while monitoring flashing process
# to stop use 'ctrl + ]'
idf.py flash monitor 

idf.py fullclean
  ```
## Starter template
- main
  - `component.mk` - useless
  - `main.c`- source code
  - `CMakeList.txt` - all the files used for configuration, including source files and imported header files. Note that there's also a `CmakeList` outside the main folder, which is responsible for importing files outside the project, and this one is responsible for files inside the project.

- project root path
  - `CMakeList.txt` - all files from the outside of the project that are used configuration 
  - `MakeFile` - useless
  - `sdkconfig` - configuration file, changing the configuration can also be done by using `idf.py menuconfig`
