# Install ESP-IDF Extension from VSCode

## For Windows     
Install ESP-IDF rom VS Code Extension, and follow the [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc6ausiKvQM) to configure the extension. It's recommended to install the ESP-IDF under the User folder, for example:

>Will install ESP-IDF master into:
>```
>      C:\Users\<Username>\esp\esp-idf
>```
>IDF tools directory (IDF_TOOLS_PATH): 
>```
>      C:\Users\<Username>\esp\.espressif
>```
